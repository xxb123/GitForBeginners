This is the project GitForBeginners. It aims to assist the newbie to learn and use git.

Sorry I just got too tired to write more words on this README file. Please read through the [git_beamer.pdf](https://github.com/weijianwen/GitForBeginners/blob/master/git_beamer.pdf?raw=true) and finish the exercises.

For the intren students in our lab, please follow me on github (Well, you can unfollow me later). Then *wait* for my message before you preceed to clone the project.

```git clone git@github.com:weijianwen/GitForBeginners.git```

Limit your modification towards the project to the *Drfat Area (below)* of README.mkd, unless you're sure that what you are doing is a *contribution* to the project.

Feedback is always welcomed. You can open an issue on github (*recommended*) or write [me](mailto:weijianwen@sjtu.edu.cn) an email.

Acknowledgement
======

+ The slides are composed with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) language, and converted to [latex beamer](https://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/wiki/Home) with [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).
+ [XeTeX](http://www.tug.org/xetex/) is a nice typesetting system. [latexmk](http://www.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc/) helps to hide the complexity of compilation.
+ The slides, along with the [project](https://github.com/weijianwen/GitForBeginners), are hosted on [github](https://github.com/).

TODO
======

+ A toc page at the beginning of every part.
+ hyperlinks to git commands

+ Handle the footnotes.
+ Add ```git show``` section.
